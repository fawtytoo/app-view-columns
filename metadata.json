Controlled by a slider in the system menu with a switch for increasing compactness for up to 12 columns.\n\nNOTE: Your display resolution will have an impact on the size of the icons and truncating of text. The maximum setting will work fine on 1920x1080 or higher, so please choose a setting suitable for your display. This is not the fault of the extension, however I currently do not know how to change this behaviour.",
